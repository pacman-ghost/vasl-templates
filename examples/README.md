# Example scenarios

This directory contains examples of *VASL Templates* in action, with the `.json` save files that you can load into the program, as well as the VASL `.vsav` scenario files created using the generated labels.

These scenarios were taken from Multi-Man Publishing's [*ASL Classic* scenario pack](http://www.multimanpublishing.com/Support/ASLASLSK/ASLOfficialDownloads/tabid/109/Default.aspx).
