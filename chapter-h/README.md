# Chapter H Vehicle/Ordnance notes

It is possible to include Chapter H notes in your VASL scenarios, but since this is copyrighted material, it is not included in releases, and you will need to set up the data yourself.

The ZIP file in this directory contains placeholder files for the Chapter H notes, refer to the [documentation](https://vasl-templates.org/help/?tab=chapterh) for instructions on how to set things up.
